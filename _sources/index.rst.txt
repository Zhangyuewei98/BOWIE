BOWIE is a tool designed for graphical analysis of binary signals from gravitational waves. It takes gridded data sets and produces different types of plots in customized arrangements for detailed analysis of gravitational wave sensitivity curves and/or binary signals. The paper detailing this tool and examples of its usage can be found at `arXiv:1807.02511`_ (Evaluating Black Hole Detectability with LISA).
