            freq_column_label (str):
                Same as previous definition inside "input_info". This will override that value if given. This is 
                    used if a specific sensitivity curve has a different file setup than the others. 

            amplitude_column_label (str):
                Same as previous definition inside "input_info". This will override that value if given. This is

            sensitivity_averaging_factor (float):
                Same as previous definition inside "input_info". This will override that value if given. This is

    par_5_name (str):
        Required
        Same as above names with one difference. If the same spin is desired for both black holes, par_3_name
            should be set to "same_spin".

    fixed_parameter_5 (float):
        Required if par_5_name != "same_spin"
        Same choices as above.

        Required
        This is for export to a file. It keeps track of quantities for future use of the file. Start time and end 
            time must be given in years. Mass must be given in solar masses. If "luminosity_distance" or "comoving_distance" is used, then the units matter. Default is "Mpc". However, "Gpc" can be given. 
        
    num_points (int): 
        Default: 8192
        This represents the number of frequency points used to represent the waveform. Smaller numbers can speed up computation, but will sacrifice accuracy at some point.

        averaging_factor (float): 
            Default: 1.0

            Default: 1.0
            Value multiplied by integral value to achieve SNR. For LISA, sqrt(2).
